# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Module 19 Neural Network repo
## Overview of Project

Final regular module challenge using neural network learning to analysis a file of charity/not-for-profit organizations.  We are working for a fictional funding foundation which is attempting to determine which charity organizations they should fund.

### Purpose
Alphabet Soup is looking for the best bang for their buck and we are here to help!  We will start as always by looking at the data contained within the file for insights regarding where our analytic time is best used.

## Analysis and Challenges
Part of the challenge here is that there are some features within the dataset whose meanings are not entirely clear.  Examples of this include "STATUS" and "Special Considerations".

We are meant to test various options for preprocessing the data prior to implementation of machine learning during Deliverable 3 where we are allowed more freedom, in a sense, to take up optimization on our own as we would on a job.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
We calculated model loss and accuracy through alll 3 deliverables for this challenge.  We were told that accuracy would be less than 75% after completing the directions for the first two deliverables.

Accuracy was indeed less than 75% so for me I took it as a goal to try to get to at least that level for Deliverable 3 where we were given the freedom to play around with both the data and the neural network options.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Having been informed that we would not fail the challenge even if we couldn't get accuracy over 75% as long as we made at least 3 attempts, we were being given a hint that this wouldn't be easy for the novices that we are at this.

## Results
I was unable to get to even 74% accuracy but I will continue to play with this dataset after our Bootcamp as I would like to learn more about how this process can work better.
